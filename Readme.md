# Project
Here i have created two applications, that are app.js and app2.js.

## app.js
It is with the basic use of lodash with express to fetch and deliver basic data.
It is an blog search and analythic tool.

## app2.js
Here i have also utilized the use of memoize function of lodash to cache the data and deliver it faster.

I have implemented the error handling in both the applications.
